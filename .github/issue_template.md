**Tips:**

1. If your watcher is not executed, try to query Elasticsearch manually first. Do you receive the results you want for your query?
For example, on Linux, you can query Elasticsearch using `curl`:

curl -X GET "localhost:9200/_search?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "query": { 
    "match_all": {}
  }
}
'
