**SENTINL** extends *Siren Investigate* and *Kibana* with **Alerting** and **Reporting** functionality to monitor, notify and report on data series changes using standard queries, programmable validators and a variety of configurable actions - Think of it as a free an independent ["Watcher"](https://github.com/sirensolutions/sentinl/wiki/SENTINL-Introduction#what-is-a-watcher) which also has scheduled ["Reporting"](https://github.com/sirensolutions/sentinl/wiki/SENTINL-Report-Example) capabilities (PNG/PDFs snapshots).

**SENTINL** is also designed to simplify the process of creating and managing alerts and reports in Siren Investigate/Kibana `6.x` via its native App Interface, or by using native watcher tools in Kibana `6.x+`.

### Event History
Alerts and Reports can easily be tracked and displayed in Kibana Charts, Widgets or Chart Annotations

### Visual Snapshots
Boss wants to see charts and reports? Use Reports to create timed snapshots of Kibana dashboards _(or any other website)_ at a set date or condition, and deliver them as email attachments.

### Help & Documentation
Documentation, Examples and Guides are available at [sentinl.readthedocs.io](http://sentinl.readthedocs.io)
